   Velveet Melmon, your defense that you are not guilty due to the fact of the arresting policeman being your nemesis does not persuade the court. I hereby find you guilty of ruining $32,000 worth of office carpeting, and attempting to burgle a flooring factory, and for illegally harboring and training a scourge of hogs to assist you in your burglary attempt.
