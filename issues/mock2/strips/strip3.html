<p>The Institute of the Rising Sun will hold its monthly exhibition, to coincide with one of Handsome Tae Se’s twelve annual birthdays. Charismatic Tae Se will not be in attendance. He is meeting to discuss an alliance against Japan with current British premier Winston Churchill.  He will be traveling via telekinesis.<p>

<p>Exalted leader Tae Se has demonstrated that the inheritance of certain traits in pea plants follows patterns of his choosing. Crop yields are expected to quadruple, unless this year has a winter. Wise Tae Sae warns of problems resulting from the American weather machine and Earth’s alleged rotation upon an axis.</p>

<p>In international news, an enormous fireball has destroyed Spain, and American song monkey Elvis has perished. Fearless Tae Se personally witnessed both events, and blames both on lower Korea. Tae Se is planning swift military action and an album in which he sings The King’s greatest hits.</p>

<p>Local agencies report an outbreak of XXXXXXX in the region between Pyongyang and XXXXXXXXX. There is no such outbreak, and these local agencies have been repurposed as economical storage places for grain. This year, there will be grain in abundance and forty percent fewer locusts. All will be rendered safe by praising the Resplendent Tae Se. </p>
