<h1>SMASH</h1>
<h2>an Anarchist coffee shop</h2>

<p>Saturday marked the opening of SMASH a coffee shop that serves espresso, drip, and cold brew coffee all through the lens of Anarchist politics. The shop is nearly empty with an espresso machine in the middle of the floor and a masked individual who sits crossed legged next to it all day(?). There are no chairs and the walls, ceiling, and floor have been painted a grey color with random splotches of other colors. When I walked in I was bombarded by a splash of hot coffee to the leg. It turns out earlier in the day "Coffee Rebels" had entered and were protesting the Hierarchy of coffee. "Pouring coffee on the elite coffee 'drinkers' smashes the idea that coffee is here for us to drink," said XT7, one of the coffee rebels.</p>

<p>After taking five to check out my hot coffee burns, I tried to order a tall Americano. But the masked server/owner told me they don't acknowledge any metric or English system of measuring anything and don't name their drinks after fat cat oppressors like America, France, or the concept of height.</p>

<p>As I drank my coffee an employee from the neighboring Panera bread stopped by to make a complaint. Apparently SMASH customers were going over to Panera to use the bathroom after downing the very strong coffee. What started innocently, escalated to the point where people were using the garbage cans to urinate in and the Dyson hand dryers to defecate in.</p>

<p>Overall I recommend SMASH to any person who enjoys coffee or confrontational behavior. Go check it out, I believe it's open everyday 24 hours a day.</p>
<p class="edit header">*** EDIT ***</p>
<p class="edit">As of this last thursday SMASH has been closed. The coffee rebels took control of a small personal plane and flew it into the side of the establishment. No one was injured. VIVA LA REVOLUCION</p>

<p>And through his excellent application of the Porkings Feint, <em>Millstabule Melmon</em> enters into the quarterfinals of the Greater Devonshire Sand-Transporting Cup.</p>
<p>This bust represents <em>Hopipheus of Melmon</em>, the ancient Greek hero who was supposed to kill Medusa or some easy shit but instead fucked every bunch of grapes on earth, which is why now when you leave grapes out for too long they become horrible, because Horpipheus just went to town on them.

<p><em>Quincy “Nash” Melmon</em> falters up the tiny stairs for nearly three minutes before finally delivering a shouted, unamplified acceptance speech and accepting his County Music Award from the floor.</p>
<p><em>Shub-Melmonath</em>, the Many-Eyed Seeker in the Glade, intones a sonorous bellowing from the unseen reaches, alerting the cultists that their offering of 28 bananas and a yogurt drink was a stupid offering and they are all bullshit idiots with dumb ideas and jerk parents.
