<p>Children, I came home from work today to find that you two raked all of the leaves in our yard into two enormous piles. I need you to tell me honestly: <i>What are you hiding in there?</i></p>
 
<p>I’m not going to be mad; I’m your father and I love you, but I just need to know what’s under those piles. Nod if I’m getting close. Is it drugs? An illegal firearm? A chasm you dug? If one of you has made some kind of mistake, let’s figure it out together. I won’t abandon you to the American justice system again.</p>
 
<p>Casey, you’re a smart girl. Mr. Martinet says one of the smartest in the whole class! Oh God, is that it? You couldn’t stand it, not being <i>the</i> smartest. You killed Billy Matthewson and buried him underneath those leaves, didn’t you? Not so bright anymore, are you, Billy? That was very clever, Casey. He’ll decompose faster in all that organic material.</p>
 
<p>Oh, okay, Mrs. Matthewson just texted me back; it looks like Billy is at home studying. Thank God. I was about to call the police. I’m sorry, Casey, but I can’t take the fall for this. Then what’s under there? They’re about the right size and shape for… I don’t know, two medium-sized rocks? Did you just cover some rocks with leaves? It’s so simple.</p>
 
<p>Kids, I’m starting to lose my patience. I would just go check under the piles and see for myself, but I can’t possibly move all those leaves. It’s so many leaves. I can’t imagine how long this must have taken you.</p>

<ul class="one">
<li>INSTRUCTOR: In here, Phillipa. Where we are going requires us to pass through the deepest part of the Academy’s dungeons.</li>
<li>PHILLIPA: Here? But teacher, I was told never, ever to go through this door.</li>
<li>INSTRUCTOR: That is what we tell the students, yes. But you are mere student no longer. Come.</li>
<li>PHILLIPA: It’s very dark. I can’t see anything.</li>
<li>INSTRUCTOR: <i>(Lights torch, with ignites a series of chandeliers illuminating the enormous chamber)</i> You are the beacon we have been waiting for, Phillipa.</li>
<li>PHILLIPA: Whoa, pretty big piano!</li>
</ul>
<ul class="two">
<li>INSTRUCTOR: Mistake, start again!</li>
<li>PHILLIPA: But Sir, I can’t jump from the D to the A#, it’s just too far for me!</li>
<li>INSTRUCTOR: When you first played piano, was Mozart too hard? Were the 32nd notes too fast? They were! They were, and you practiced and then they weren’t.</li>
<li>PHILLIPA: But these keys are ten feet apart. I can’t jump ten feet. I think this piano is too big.</li>
<li>INSTRUCTOR: <i>(Gives scandalized look and throws bucket of ice water)</i> AGAIN.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="three">
<li>INSTRUCTOR: What are you doing Phillipa?!</li>
<li>PAUL: Oh, she’s just helping me perfect the Chopin piece for my recital.</li>
<li>INSTRUCTOR: No, she is reinforcing bad habits for her own piano playing!</li>
<li>PHILLIPA: What, because I’m playing a regular piano and not the big piano?</li>
<li>INSTRUCTOR: … Now Paul knows there is a big piano hidden under the Academy. Paul, come with me.</li>
<li>PHILLIPA: Wait, it’s my fault! I said it, don’t punish him!</li>
<li>INSTRUCTOR: I cannot kill the best hope we have of playing the big piano. But I can absolutely kill Paul.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="four">
<li>INSTRUCTOR: <i>(Weeping furiously)</i> Come in, Phillipa. I can hear you there. It’s well after curfew.</li>
<li>PHILLIPA: I snuck down here to practice.</li>
<li>INSTRUCTOR: Ah, of course you did. Admirable. <i>(Standing up, examining the big piano)</i> You’re the first to attempt the big piano since Eustace Feurtson. Four years before I enrolled as a student myself. He failed spectacularly, as all do.</li>
<li>PHILLIPA: Why build such a big piano in the first place?</li>
<li>INSTRUCTOR: Fool. Do you think the piano was built for the Academy? Phillipa, the Academy was built to conceal the piano. It is eons old, an ancient relic of incomprehensible origin. To train the world’s greatest pianists is a mere byproduct of the Academy, a purposeless offal of our pursuit to find one who might unlock the big piano’s power. That is why you are here.</li>
<li>PHILLIPA: Then I shall not fail.</li>
<li>INSTRUCTOR: Because of your “talent?”</li>
<li>PHILLIPA: Because of my hate.</li>
<li>INSTRUCTOR: Hmm. <i>(Begins leaving chamber)</i> Good enough. <i>(Leaves)</i></li>
</ul>
<ul class="five">
<li>MASKED APPARITION: <strong>You may begin.</strong></li>
<li>PHILLIPA: <i>(Stomps quickly on three keys and jumps to one three feet away)</i></li>
<li>INSTRUCTOR: <i>(Standing on dais amidst swirling green flame)</i> Yes! Yes Phillipa, play!</li>
<li>PHILLIPA: <i>(Tries to jump to F key fifteen feet away and falls on ass)</i></li>
<li>MASKED APPARITION: <strong>A mistake.</strong></li>
<li>INSTRUCTOR: <i>(As green flames dissipate)</i> No… No! Wait! Forgive us! I have sacrificed all for this! <i>(Slashes carotid artery with ornate dagger)</i> I would sacrifice… more… <i>(dies)</i></li>
<li>MASKED APPARITION: <strong><i>(Slowly fades)</i></strong></li>
<li>PHILLIPA: Wait, before you go! Why did you leave this piano here? What is this all for?!</li>
<li>MASKED APPARITION: <strong>The piano was meant as a gift to humanity, yet you have spat upon our generosity by sending only your tiniest to play it in scornful mockery.</strong></li>
<li>PHILLIPA: I’m not tiny. What?</li>
<li>MASKED APPARITION: <strong>We believed humanity would grow enormous over the eons, towering above all that remained in our absence.</strong></li>
<li>PHILLIPA: No, we top out around six feet.</li>
<li>MASKED APPARITION: <strong>Whoa nuts. We thought you’d all be forty feet at least.</strong></li>
<li>PHILLIPA: No.</li>
<li>MASKED APPARITION: <strong>Haha jeez do we look dumb. Well, sorry about that, sorry the piano’s too big, if we were rude, etcetera. <i>(Fades)</i></strong></li>
<li>PHILLIPA: Why did you think we’d get big, why did that make sense?</li>
<li>MASKED APPARITION: <strong><i>(Still fading)</i> Uh oooooooooh we’re already gone ooooooooh this is just a shadow now ooooooooooh.</strong></li>
