<p>Hello, I am Glinbarto Melmon, and as much as I regret that I must do so having recently been informed of your experiences in WWII, I am nevertheless contractually bound to present this screener of my upcoming rom-com, Boogie Hitlers.</p>

<p>With his turgid vertical, hideous wingspan, and heteronormative conditioning, Siglund Melmon might be the worst Dirty Bocce Ball player of all time, Stan.</p>

<p>Ninklak Melmon is a pioneer of an award-losing health system based around slow trickle urination. The key, says Dr. Melmon (NOTE: IS NOT AND NEVER WILL BE A MEDICAL DOCTOR), are excruciating thirty-minute urination sessions twelve times a day.</p>

<p>I never knew Corn Mama’s real name.</p>

<p>Our paths only crossed once: the Paynesville County Fair, October 14, 1978. She husked corn with more passion than the Nebraskan summer sun.</p>

<p>Of course, I had a front row ticket to the annual corn shucking contest. When I saw Corn Mama on stage, I knew without even looking at her substantial forearms that she was created for greatness. Under her steamed tortoise shell glasses, her eyes bulged with an untamed eagerness to unclothe corn.</p>

<p>From when the judge rang the opening bell, Corn Mama shucked very quickly. There was so much I needed to know, like if was she from Nebraska or Heaven. Pondering this, I missed a whole minute of the action. I tuned back to find Corn Mama leading by 27 ears of corn with a minute left, a margin obviously too robust for any competitor to overcome.</p>

<p>Then, with an air of sacredness, Corn Mama halted. She husked one more ear of corn and sprinkled on it a dash of paprika from her pocket. In the tense hush of the crowd, Corn Mama ravished it. She ravished it more romantically than I’ve seen corn on the cob ever ravished.</p>

<p>I never saw Corn Mama after that day. I could not attend the next year’s contest due to my arthritis. She did not attend the 1980 contest. I call her Corn Mama because she exuded every quality of matriarchy. I have no idea what her actual name is.</p>
