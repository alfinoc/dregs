<div class="dinosaurs" title="EWvS">

<p>Dinosaurs ruined everything and then died. They were bad at roaming the Earth and not dying. Imagine a million tree-sized leathery lizards just screaming because there's no sun and they can't see all the leaves they want to eat. That's what it was like in the dino world, or should I say whino world because of how the dinosaurs obviously whined a bunch and didn't do anything else.</p>

<p>I could probably have killed sixty or seventy dinosaurs with my hands and a few good kicks to their sensitive bellies. Give me six months with the dinosaurs and I would become their indisputable ruler. I'd be organizing dino garbage collection and dino cooking. Inventing games for them to play. Teaching them not to sit on their own eggs, which they did all the time.</p>

<p>When dinosaurs lumbered around the piles of sand that made up early Earth, they still found stuff to trip over. They'd be trying to eat a fern and then their ridiculous legs would slip out and they'd fall into a hole they had dug to put their head in at night or something. Then they would die and a million years later we'd find their skeleton still curled up in an idiot pose.</p>

<p>How long did dinos roam the earth? Like millions of years? And in all that time they clearly didn't learn anything.</p>

<p>Dinosaurs are so shitty they should not be called dinosaurs. They should be called something terrible, like Bloogs.</p>
