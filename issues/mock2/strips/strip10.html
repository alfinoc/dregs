<p>Dog Tricks For Marvo</p>

<p><i>Marvo, I have prepared for you a translation of all the tricks your incredible new dog shall know. It is my gift for you, Marvo! – Pete</i></p>

<p><span>“Roll over”</span> — Oh Marvo, when you see the dog perform his incredible spinning, you will know that I hold you dear as a true friend, Marvo. Oh he will spin the long way.</p>

<p><span>“Sit”</span> — 35 years, Marvo! A man of 35 years must have a dog that can wait for him on the ground. That is what this does Marvo. The dog waits, but it is called “sit.”</p>

<p><span>“Come”</span> — I weep as I write this Marvo. The dog, he will be at your side if you say this, always. Oh Marvo it is a thing of great beauty. Oh the dog.</p>

<p><span>“Play dead”</span> — A joke, Marvo! It is only a joke that the dog he is dead. You must not take this in anger. It is a jest, Marvo, a fine one, for you!</p>

<p><span>“Speak”</span> — What, Marvo? Is the dog the man? You will listen to him “speak,” and say, maybe I am the dog. You will get a bone and a little outside house, perhaps I think! Marvo.</p>

<p><span>“Fetch”</span> — The dog can get the milk bottle if your milk idiot has misplaced it, Marvo. Three days now the milk idiot has placed my milk in the driveway. I punch my wall I am so mad.</p>

<p><span>“Stay”</span> — I do not understand this Marvo. I do not know what this should do. Never say this Marvo. This is the one you must never say.</p>
